# BookMart

## Folder Structure
- **Frontend:** `client`
- **Backend:** `server`

## Directions

### Online PostgreSQL Database
The app now connects to an online PostgreSQL database, removing the need for a local database setup on individual machines. The backend is pre-configured to access the online database for seamless data management.

### Frontend/Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the root directory: `bookmart-main`.
2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
3. In the base directory "bookmart" run 'npm run installer' in a powershell or bash instance to create all of the correct packages in the correct place.
3.5. In cases where the npm installer does not work properly, navigate to the individual directories and run 'npm install' in the respective directories to install the node_modules properly.
  
### Startup
  - Go to the primary directory and run 'npm start' to begin running both the backend and frontend concurrently, or start up the backend and then the frontend in their own individual directories.

## End User Manual

### Notes
If the app has already been set up previously, users only need to run `npm start` to launch it again. The setup steps are only required for initial installation.
